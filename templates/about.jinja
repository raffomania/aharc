## About the AskHistorians Archive Observer

This is an *unofficial* archive of the subreddit [/r/AskHistorians](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/). It's
ad-free, works on
mobile, loads fast, and doesn't need JS.

### Features

- Full-text search
- Collapse comments
- No AutoMod comments
- Only shows posts with actual answers

Posts are sorted in reverse chronological order and filtered to show only those with accepted answers. It only contains
posts made after {} for now.

### Contact

Made by [Rafael](https://www.rafa.ee) with ðŸ¦€. Check out my other projects:

- [knakk](https://raffomania.itch.io/knakk), a solitaire game with a twist
- [Song Sonar](https://songsonar.rocks/), a spotify playlist with releases of artists you follow

The [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/raffomania/aharc), where
you can [report bugs and request features](https://github.com/raffomania/aharc/issues) as well.
You can also [find me on lemmy](https://lemmy.world/u/raffomania) if you don't have a GitHub account.

### Project Status

The project is pretty much done for now. I'm actively reviewing pull requests, and I might revisit it in the future if
enough people request changes :) Here are
some ideas for improvements:

- Show nested comments
- Other ways to sort posts, like upvotes, number of answers, chronological order
- Option to hide read posts
- Add posts from other subreddits like AskScience

### Your Own Subreddit Archive

You can generate your own site
for another subreddit! [Have a look at the README](https://github.com/raffomania/aharc#readme) for instructions
on compiling the project - [hit me up on lemmy](https://lemmy.world/u/raffomania)
if you'd like me to upload pre-compiled binaries.
