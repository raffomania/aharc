## About

This is an archive of the subreddit [/r/AskHistorians](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/). It's ad-free, works on
mobile, loads fast, and works without JS.

Posts are sorted in reverse chronological order and filtered to show only those with accepted answers. Since it's hosted
on the Netlify
free tier, it only contains posts made after {} for now.

The [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/raffomania/aharc). If you want to generate your own pages
for another subreddit, you need to compile it yourself for now - [hit me up on lemmy](https://lemmy.world/u/raffomania)
if you'd like me to upload pre-compiled binaries.

Made by [Rafael](https://www.rafa.ee) with ðŸ¦€.
